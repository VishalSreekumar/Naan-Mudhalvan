**Project Definition**

- The project involves analyzing COVID-19 cases and deaths data using IBM Cognos with the main goal of comparing mean values and standard deviations of cases and deaths per day and by country in the EU/EEA (European Union/European Economic Area).

Design Approach

**Data Collection**

- We will obtain and pre-process COVID-19 data from a provided data file, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.

VisualizationStrategy

- We will leverage IBM Cognos to create informative charts and graphs that convey comparisons of mean values and standard deviations across countries and time. Insights Generation
- By analyzing the data statistically, comparing results, identifying patterns, and creating narratives, we aim to derive valuable insights from the COVID-19 data in the EU/EEA region.
