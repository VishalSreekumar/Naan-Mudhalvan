**COVID-19 CASES ANALYSIS**

The project involves analyzing COVID-19 cases and deaths data using IBM Cognos with the main goal of comparing mean values and standard deviations of cases and deaths per day and by country in the EU/EEA (European Union/European Economic Area). Design Approach

**Step 1: Data Collection:**

- Gather historical patients data, including attributes such as patients *recovery time, medical history, any other diseases affected, and patients*
- medication information.
- Ensure data quality by addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

**Step 2: Data Preprocessing:**

- Cleanse the data by handling outliers ,missing values and duplicates.
- Transform categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one- hot encoding or label encoding).
- Normalize or scale numerical features as needed.

**Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

- Visualize and analyze the data to gain insights into patients medical behavior.
- Identify patterns, correlations, and potential factors influencing covid-19 diseases to spread.
- EDA helps in feature selection and understanding the data better.

**Step 4: Feature Selection:**

- Use techniques like feature importance, correlation analysis, and domain

knowledge to select the most relevant features for predicting covid-19 cases.

- Remove redundant or irrelevant features to simplify the model.

**Step 5: Data Splitting:**

- Split the data into training, validation, and test sets. A common split might be 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.

Ensure that the data is split in a way that maintains the distribution of covid-19 patients and non-covid-19 patients in each set.

**Step 6: Model Training:**

- Train the selected models on the training data.
- Tune hyper parameters using techniques like grid search or random search to optimize model performance.

**Step 7: Model Evaluation:**

- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix.
- Use the validation set to fine-tune the model further.

**Step 8: Model Interpretability:**

- Interpret the model's predictions to understand factors that a causes the covid-19 diseases to the people.

**Step 9: Model Deployment:**

- Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it in a production environment.
- Integrate the model into your business processes, such as CRM systems or marketing automation tools.

**Step 10: Monitoring and Maintenance:**

- Continuously monitor the model's performance in production.
- Retrain the model periodically with fresh data to ensure it stays up-to-date.
- Adapt strategies based on model predictions to reduce churn.

**Step 11: Feedback Loop:**

- Establish a feedback loop with business stakeholders to gather insights on model performance.
